   LearningLayout - Minimal layout for video learning experience
   Part of Student Learning Space v2.2.0

   This layout removes the main site header to provide a
   distraction-free, LinkedIn Learning-style experience.

   CRITICAL: This is a ROOT layout that replaces MainLayout completely.
   No header, no footer - just the learning content.

   v2.2.0-dev: Updated for Tailwind CSS 4-column fixed layout

@code {
    // This is a minimal root layout - no shared components
    // The child content (Learn.razor) handles the full viewport layout
}
